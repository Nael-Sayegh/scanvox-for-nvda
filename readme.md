# Presentation

This add-on uses the Scanvox software to read your paper documents. It was created with the help of the software developer and does not require any additional installation.

## Prerequisites 

To use this add-on, you must have a USB scanner connected to your computer that is compatible with TWAIN or WIA, which is the case with most scanners.

## How it works

To use this add-on, go to the NVDA menu, then select Scanvox. In this dialog, you can start a scan by clicking on the Scan button. The scan takes a few seconds to start, and then, at the end of the scanning process, the scanned text is automatically read out loud. You can deactivate automatic playback by going to the NVDA settings menu, then to the scanvox for NVDA category. Press this button until all pages have been scanned. If you want to delete the page you just scanned, you can press the "delete last scanned page" button next to the scanned button with tabulation or by using the shortcut alt+l. Once finished, you can read the different scanned pages by doing shift+tab from the scanned button or by doing alt+t to access an editing area with the content of all the pages. In this edit area, if you want to move quickly from page to page, you can use the previous page and next page buttons, or use the shortcuts ctrl+shift+up arrow and ctrl+shift+down arrow. You can save the file or open it directly in Notepad using the corresponding buttons.
If you want to delete the scanned pages to scan a new document, you can press the button to cancel all scanned pages.
When you exit Scanvox, all scanned pages are erased.
